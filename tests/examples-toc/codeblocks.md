# Should ignore heading looking things within code blocks

## Examples

### This applies to ticked blocks:

```
# I am a comment not a heading
a = 1
```

### Ticked+tagged blocks:

```python
# I am a comment not a heading
a = 1
```

### And also indented blocks:

    # I am a comment not a heading
    a = 1


## Next header
